  <h1>Faith: The Unholy Trinity - Episode 1</h1>
  <p>You are Father Gabriel, a priest who's been tasked with investigating a strange cult in the woods. Your sidekick, Asmodeus, a demon who's sworn to protect you at all costs. As you make your way through the forest, you suddenly find yourself surrounded by a pack of monsters! Asmodeus is ready for combat...</p>
  <p>The monsters attack with vicious claws and fangs! Asmodeus avoids their strikes and retaliates with a flurry of punches and kicks. Can you help him fight off the monsters and survive the night in the haunted forest?</p>
  <p>The monsters are tough, but you're not a stranger to danger. Asmodeus looks to you for guidance in the fight. Will you choose rock, paper, or scissors?</p>
